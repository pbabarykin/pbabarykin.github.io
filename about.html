            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p> WELL BLESSED Ministry is design to serve needs of broken and lost people. The purpose is to guide people who needs guidance, to share pain, blame, shame, and emptiness with those who daily get overwhelmed with them.
Our vision is to unify people who feels no hope or sees no way out of brokenness. We will do this through sharing the truth about how we feel, how we fail, how we fight with no strength to fight, or how we cry out with no ability to even whisper how bad we feel. <a href="resources.html"> More</a>

            <h2>My story</h2>
            <p> My name is Filipp Babarokin. I am from a small town in Estonia called Narva. I was born in a big Christian family with four brothers and three sisters. My Christian path started in 2016 after a car accident with my friends. The story is simple. We got into a car accident, I spent two weeks laying down in my bed, and then changes appeared. I went to a Wednesday sermon, heard encouraging words and repented. From that moment I have kept failing God again and again.
            </p>
          <p>If you know this feeling when you want to honor God the way He deserves it, and you want to be a better person, but daily you see how incapable you are. This discouraging feeling when you just know that even if you have abilities to do something for God, it will not be a perfect fruit or sacrifice to God only because you keep failing him in all areas of your life. Then, how can you serve Him? This has been my struggle ever since I decided to give my life to God.</p>
          <p> Also, this is the reason why I want to share my thoughts, my pain, my disappointment in myself, my fear and emptiness with those feel the same way. I want to keep faith and hope that God loves me and you no matter what we are going through. On the contrary, He loves us because we are still trying to belong to Him while facing these imperfections of flesh.  </p>
