		<h3>May Christians drink alcohol?</h3>
            <p> I am aware that I am not some authoritative academic source whose word defines the attitude of Christendom towards alcohol. This is not my task. My desire is to help you if you are trying to find ways to truly live life in a relationship with God. One of the hardest parts of the Christian life is being truly dedicated to God. Most of us know our moral bar on what is permissible and what is not. Often we allow circumstances to change our mind to get out of a difficult situation. It is easier to do something against your moral foundations than to feel pain, heaviness and responsibility for your choices for a long time.</p>
	<p>This is the complexity of the practical life of a Christian. It's not hard for us to make a decision and determine what would be right. It is difficult for us to hold on to the decision we have made, because everything around us presses and distracts from the decision. I would like to help you find ways to maintain your good conscience (1 Tim 1:19) rather than making compromises that destroy the spirit.</p>
<p>	Despite the manipulation of Scripture by Christians against alcohol and Christians who support alcohol, the Bible does not provide a clear answer about alcohol. Throughout the Bible, in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, you can see that people drank wine. Most say "even Jesus drank wine, so it is definitely possible”. I don’t want to argue that the wine at that time was different from our wine. It doesn't make sense. You have to look at the big picture that we see in the Scriptures: </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> "20 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise" (Proverbs 20:1, KJV)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">"20 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:
21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags" (Proverbs 23:20-21, KJV)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">"29 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?
30 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.
31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright" (Proverbs 23:29-31, KJV)</p>

<p>I am not trying to convince you that drinking wine is a sin. I don't think so myself. I’m just trying to show that it’s an unwise decision to let alcohol into your life. Wisdom protects us from mistakes, pain, stupidity. If a person is addicted to alcohol and cannot refuse it, although he wants to, then this is a completely different conversation. For this, there are ministries that help people fight addiction. For me, the important thing is sincerity with myself and the willingness to admit that it might be wiser to give up alcohol. </p>

           <h3>Christianity is a hoax and hypocrisy</h3>
            <p>In my Instagram profile I asked the question “What is the main problem of Christians”? Most popular response was hypocrisy. Obviously, these answers cannot be universal for all Christians and churches in the world because the respondents are products of their society and the circumstances that were around them. This is exactly the society in which I grew up, so this topic is close to me. I can give my opinion why hypocrisy is the main problem in that place.</p>
            <p>I agree that hypocrisy is wrong. However, I do not agree that this is the main problem of Christians. I also disagree that it is hypocrisy that drives people away from the church and the Christian community. Hypocrisy is wrong because it is a sin that God wants to take us from. It is sin that is the main problem that worries people in the church. Therefore, I will explain why it is wrong to leave the church because of hypocrisy, and also, I will give the reasons for hypocrisy known to me, and how to deal with it.<p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">Hypocrisy is a sin</p>
              <p>I find it undeniable that hypocrisy is a sin. But, for a more transparent picture, it is worth defining what “sin” is. In his book The Reason for God, T. Keller (2008)  paraphrases the Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard, to define sin, “Sin is seeking to become oneself, to get an identity, apart from him [God]” (p. 168). Thus, when people are hypocrites, they try to find themselves, but without God. I can identify two of the most common cases of hypocrisy. The first type of hypocrisy is when people communicate well with each other, but behind their backs they say bad and offensive things about a person. The second type, when people come to church and pray to God, sing praise songs and say Amen to the sermon, but outside the church they lead a sinful lifestyle; they drink alcohol, watch pornography, dirty TV shows, use black humor and are no different from non-Christians. That is, their life is different from what they believe in.
	“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners" (Mark 2:17). Christ came to earth to serve sinners and show them the way to salvation. It would be logical to say that people who call themselves Christians must already be “cured” of sin, because they have already followed Christ and received salvation. But the reality  this essay about shows that many Christians remain in sin. Why is that?
 </p>
<p>There are two reasons I am aware of. First, people did not accept Jesus as their Lord of life, to whom they give their life. But just saying it out loud is not enough. If a person says that Jesus is his Lord, but lives as if he himself is the master and king of his life, then little will change in his behavior and character. People, driven by their desires and will, are focused on success and comfort. Success and comfort are not bad, but Jesus says, “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also”. (Matthew 6:21) Thus, a person's heart does not change, and he remains in sin, often blinded by self-righteousness, if comfort and success are not just fruits of the relationship with Jesus. 
	The second reason is our skeptical view of a person, not giving him a chance. People who have accepted Jesus as their Master do not change instantly. It is a lifelong cleansing process. The fact that a person is still hypocritical may mean that he has not yet seen in his own eye a beam that he needs to pull out with God’s help. However, if we condemn a person and do not trust him in the hands of God, then we take the place of the judge of souls, which is also a sin.
</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms”. (Ephesians 6:12)</p>
  <p>It is very important to understand that the people in the church are not our enemies. From a theoretical point of view, it is very easy to realize and accept, but in practice we meet with real situations. Is it easy to understand that the person who talks about you behind your back, spreads rumors about you and creates you a bad reputation is not really your enemy? How to deal with such situations? Someone once said, "Wounded people always hurt others."</p>
  <p>The first and main way to help a person is a prayer. The prayer of intercession for another person has a huge role in the spiritual world, through which we can shape the material reality in which we live.</p>
  <p>The second way, quite obvious, but effective. You need to have a dialogue with a person. It is worth approaching and lovingly explaining what you know about the evil that is addressed to you. I believe that if you declare to a person's face that you are imperfect, but love God and work on yourself, and also forgive a person for his evil, then this will have a healing effect on him as well.</p>
  <p>The last method I know that I would highly recommend to absolutely everyone is patience and love. My advice to people who leave the church because of the hypocrites in it - do not leave, but train patience and love. Judging a person for hypocrisy is also a sin. Look at it from the other side. What is more good for a hypocrite? From a person who remained the object of rumors, or from a person who is in the same community and shows in practice how living with Christ transforms life?
