		<h3>May Christians drink alcohol?</h3>
            <p> I am aware that I am not some authoritative academic source whose word defines the attitude of Christendom towards alcohol. This is not my task. My desire is to help you if you are trying to find ways to truly live life in a relationship with God. One of the hardest parts of the Christian life is being truly dedicated to God. Most of us know our moral bar on what is permissible and what is not. Often we allow circumstances to change our mind to get out of a difficult situation. It is easier to do something against your moral foundations than to feel pain, heaviness and responsibility for your choices for a long time.</p>
	<p>This is the complexity of the practical life of a Christian. It's not hard for us to make a decision and determine what would be right. It is difficult for us to hold on to the decision we have made, because everything around us presses and distracts from the decision. I would like to help you find ways to maintain your good conscience (1 Tim 1:19) rather than making compromises that destroy the spirit.</p>
<p>	Despite the manipulation of Scripture by Christians against alcohol and Christians who support alcohol, the Bible does not provide a clear answer about alcohol. Throughout the Bible, in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, you can see that people drank wine. Most say "even Jesus drank wine, so it is definitely possible”. I don’t want to argue that the wine at that time was different from our wine. It doesn't make sense. You have to look at the big picture that we see in the Scriptures: </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> "20 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise" (Proverbs 20:1, KJV)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">"20 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:
21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags" (Proverbs 23:20-21, KJV)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">"29 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?
30 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.
31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright" (Proverbs 23:29-31, KJV)</p>


<p>I am not trying to convince you that drinking wine is a sin. I don't think so myself. I’m just trying to show that it’s an unwise decision to let alcohol into your life. Wisdom protects us from mistakes, pain, stupidity. If a person is addicted to alcohol and cannot refuse it, although he wants to, then this is a completely different conversation. For this, there are ministries that help people fight addiction. For me, the important thing is sincerity with myself and the willingness to admit that it might be wiser to give up alcohol. </p>
